## Hi my name is Jarryd!
### I am an IT Engineer who is interested mainly in System Engineering and automation.

I am currently learning Python and JavaScript, and I have experience in C and Python with the Harvard CS50 course and Java with a partially complete Diploma of Information Technology.

Something that also interests me is DevOps and Cloud Development, as I have some experience using cloud infrastructure in AWS
and I also have experience professionally in Linux(both cmd and GUI), Windows and MacOS.

I'm looking to collaborate on any project that will test my skills and engage me to learn new things.
You can reach me either by email at [jarrydstanbrook@hotmail.com](mailto:jarrydstanbrook@hotmail.com) 
or via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarrydstanbrook/)
